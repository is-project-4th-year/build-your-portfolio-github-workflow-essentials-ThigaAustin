## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program
**🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Commit Messages**
`Expectation 👀` : I thought commit messages were short and random
`Reality 😅`: I learned how to write structured, meaningful commit messages using types like feat, fix, and style.
`Impact 💡`: My commit history is now readable and organized. It helped me track how each feature (like the contact form) evolved over time.

**2. Concept: Project Boards**
`Expectation 👀` : I thought project boards were visual only
`Reality 😅`: Managing issues with a board was a game-changer. It gave me a real-time view of what’s pending, in progress, or completed.
`Impact 💡`: I used columns like “To Do”, “In Progress”, and “Done” to track tasks across pages. It helped me stay focused and complete everything on time.

**3. Concept: Merge Conflicts**
`Expectation 👀` :  I honestly hoped I wouldn’t run into merge conflicts.
`Reality 😅`: I ran into a conflict while editing the same footer across two branches. It taught me how Git detects file changes and how to manually resolve and commit clean code.
`Impact 💡`: I now understand how to handle merge conflicts in future projects.
